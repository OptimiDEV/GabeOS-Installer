------------------------------------------------

Preamble:

The purpose of this license is to ensure that everyone is free to FucK with this software—use it, copy it, modify it, redistribute it, reproduce with it, and even pretend you made it—as long as they let others do the same.

We believe in open knowledge, wild creativity, and zero shame. If you’re bold enough to use this license, you probably already know what you're doing. Or you’re just here for the name. Either way, you’re welcome.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification:

1. You may use, modify, and distribute the software licensed under FucKv2 for any purpose, personal or commercial, without restriction.

2. Any redistributed or modified version of this software must retain this license in its entirety. Yes, the name too. Don’t chicken out.

3. There is no warranty, express or implied. If this software deletes your homework, corrupts your soul, or makes your crush ignore you, it's not our fault.

4. You are not required to attribute the original author(s), but if you do, they’ll probably appreciate it. Or not. It’s up to them.

5. You may fork, rebrand, remix, or ritualistically chant this software, as long as the result remains under the FucKv2 License. You break it, you keep both pieces.

6. By using this license, you acknowledge that you are participating in an extremely unserious act of extremely serious freedom.
